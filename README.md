# The Gender Pay Gap by Occupational Expectations

> The datasets were compiled from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' NLSY79 survey data as part of a research project on gender wage disparity. To run the R code, only the csv files are needed for importing, and do not require downloading. The remaining directories provide information about the source and origin of the data. For more information about NLS data and methods, see https://www.bls.gov/nls/ .
